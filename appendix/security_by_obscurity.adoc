== Security by Obscurity Assessment

The Security by Obscurity approach would not make sense for this project for several reasons. Security by Obscurity is a practice where the details of a security mechanism are kept hidden as a method of providing security and are not recommended in practice. The strength of this application’s security should rely on the robustness of its security measures, not on the secrecy of its mechanisms. Since the application stores and handles sensitive user data, including personal information, health, and location data, many data protection regulations require transparency about how this data is secured, which contradicts the principle of security by obscurity. In the context of this application, if the security mechanisms are kept secret and those secrets are somehow exposed or discovered, the entire security of the application could be compromised. This is a significant risk, especially considering that the application handles sensitive user data, including personal information and health data. Transparency also allows for trust to be built with users, with how their data is being secured and handled. Users are more likely to trust the application with their data if they know that strong, industry-standard security measures are in place. Therefore, instead of relying on obscurity, the application should implement modern proven security measures such as data encryption, secure data transmission protocols, and regular security audits. The app should also comply with all relevant data protection laws and regulations, which don’t align with an obscurity approach. These measures provide a much stronger and more reliable form of security than obscurity.


A situation in which security by obscurity would be violated is when the secrecy of the security mechanism is revealed such as being disclosed in documentation, comments, or error messages. If that happens the mechanisms are then compromised. If an attacker is able to reverse engineering the applications code base, it is possible that they would be able to discover the hidden security mechanisms. Similarly, an insider with knowledge of the mechanism could disclose or discover the security mechanisms. These situations impose a significant risk to the security of the application
