== Security by Property Assessment

Maintaining confidentiality for the ACME RUN app is crucial to safeguard sensitive information and user privacy. A robust policy should be in place, ensuring that proprietary data, including user profiles and app features, is securely stored on protected servers accessible only to authorized personnel. This entails implementing stringent access controls, both physical and digital, to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Additionally, when it comes to user interactions such as friend connections, the app should incorporate privacy settings, allowing users to control who can access their shared information. By not sharing users' private records, trail paths, or upcoming runs with their connections confidentiality is achieved. Users can choose to share upcoming runs using a secondary calendar for inviting friends to join them. Badge disclosures are subject to user approval, ensuring data confidentiality. Additionally, data collected from Heart Rate Monitors (HRMs) remains accessible only to the specific user, upholding stringent confidentiality standards and respecting user privacy. By enforcing data separation and implementing privacy controls, the app ensures that personal details and operational aspects are kept confidential, creating a secure and trustworthy environment for users to engage in fitness activities and connect with friends.

Ensuring availability for the ACME RUN app involves implementing a thorough strategy to guarantee users uninterrupted access to the application's services. A robust availability policy should be implemented, indicating the expected level of service, such as timely authentication and responsiveness to user requests. This approach ensures optimal service levels, quality expectations, and system reliability. Deploying the app on robust, scalable servers ensures quick handling of user requests and proactive monitoring of any potential bugs or issues that could arise. As such, the app can achieve rapid availability of geo-spatial features such as nearby trails, and potential searches conducted by the user. By following such guidelines the app is a reliable platform for its users, meeting their expectations for access, and providing a positive overall experience.
