=== (S.4) Detailed usage scenarios

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Examples of interaction between the environment (or human users) and the system, expressed as user stories. Such scenarios are not by themselves a substitute for precise descriptions of functionality (<<s3>>), but provide an important complement by specifying cases that these behavior descriptions must support; they also serve as a basis for developing test cases. The scenarios most relevant for stakeholders are given in chapter <<g5>> in the Goals book, at a general level, as use cases; in contrast, <<s4>> can refer to system components and functionality (from other chapters of the System book) as well as special and erroneous cases, and introduce more specific scenarios._  <<BM22>>

**S.4.1: Initiating a Running Session**:


**Use Case**: <<UC1>> , <<UC2>>

**Primary Actor**: Runner

**Precondition**: User has the app installed, logged in, and GPS and other necessary permissions allowed.

**Trigger**: User starts a run.

**Main Success Scenario**:

. User opens the fitness app.
. The app prompts the user to start a running session.
. User connects to a heart rate monitor (HRM) if available.
. The app suggests nearby trails within the user's radius.
. User selects a trail and chooses the mode.
. The app will prompt the user to a drop down menu of different modes to play, and provide further instructions for hardcore mode.
. During the run, the app collects data and regularly updates the run information.
. The app adapts the user's training plan based on factors such as their decisions against virtual enemies and heart rate data, as well as their history of preferences.

**Success Postcondition**:
The user completes the running session, and the app updates their training plan based on the collected data. Virtual enemies encountered during the run contribute to the user's progress in the app.

**Secondary Scenarios**:

. User decides not to connect the HRM, limiting the data collected during the run.
. User is not satisfied with trail options near them, user gives up and walks around the neighborhood instead.

**Importance**:
This scenario showcases the process to starting a run and the preliminary choices a user can make before starting. It also highlights the process and the user inputs that are relevant to start.

This illustrates the choice that a user can make regarding connecting their HRM, as well as the order of interactions throughout their experience with the app. It demonstrates the actions taken when picking a run, from opening to finding a route.


**S.4.2: Confronting Virtual Enemies**:


**Use Case**: <<UC1>> , <<UC2>>, <<UC3>> , <<UC4>>

**Primary Actor**: Runner

**Precondition**: User is in an active running session.

**Trigger**:  The app generates virtual enemies to confront the user.

**Main Success Scenario**:

. During a running session, the app generates virtual enemies that confront the user.
. The app prompts the user with a pop up that lists options for confronting the enemy: sheltering, escaping, or fighting back.
. If the user chooses to fight back or to escape, the app provides further instructions accordingly.
. Otherwise, if the user is not in hardcore mode and chooses to take shelter, the app shows nearby zones where the user can rest based on location.
. Tracks progress by allowing the user to click a completion button for each of the different options.


**Success Postcondition**:
. The user successfully deals with the virtual enemies, completing the confrontation segment of the running session. The app records the user's choices for further analysis.

**Secondary Scenarios**:

. User encounters technical issues during the confrontation segment, leading to an incomplete experience.
. User in hardcore mode struggles to maintain the required speed, affecting their overall performance.

**Importance**:
This indicates the additional components to the mode, and the pop ups that alert the user according to their mode. It is key to enriching the user's experience when trying the different modes.


**S.4.3: Updating Geographical Zone or Trails**:


**Use Case**: <<UC1>> , <<UC4>>

**Primary Actor**: Admin Team

**Precondition**: Admin Team has access to the app's admin portal.

**Trigger**:  Admin Team decides to update geographical zones or trails.

**Main Success Scenario**:

. Admin Team opens the app through an admin portal.
. Admin Team accesses the database of predefined geographical zones and trails.
. Admin Team adds and updates the geographical zones and trails based on discussions with other collaborators.
. The app prompts the team to finalize changes and push the new update to users' phones.

**Success Postcondition**:
. The app's geographical zones and trails are successfully updated, reflecting the changes made by the Admin Team. Users can now access the new trails and zones.

**Secondary Scenarios**:

. Technical issues prevent the app from pushing the update to users, causing a delay in reflecting the changes.
. Incomplete collaboration with local authorities leads to inaccuracies in the updated geographical information.

**Importance**:
This allows for continuous improvement of the chosen trails. It also caters to a larger area as more routes are added to the database, hence why streamlining the process of modidying the routes is critical.


**S.4.4: Checking Badges and Fitness Achievements**:


**Use Case**: <<UC1>> , <<UC5>>

**Primary Actor**: Runner

**Precondition**: User is logged into the app and has completed runs.

**Trigger**: User wants to check their badges and fitness achievements.

**Main Success Scenario**:

. Featured badges and challenges are displayed on the user's profile for ongoing events and global challenges.
. The user can view all possible challenges and badges.
. The user can see potential challenges, track their progress to earning certain badges and completing challenges.
. The user can find new badges and completed challenges shown on their profile.


**Success Postcondition**:
The user reviews their badges and achievements, motivating them to set new fitness goals. The virtual badge earned is displayed prominently on their profile.

**Secondary Scenarios**:

. User encounters a technical glitch, temporarily preventing them from accessing their badges and achievements.
. The app fails to update the user's profile with the recently earned badge.

**Importance**:
This is critical to maintain user engagement and provide a challenging aspect to the platform. It also ensures continuous usage of the app, gaining a loyal group of users. 


**S.4.5: Reviewing Run Statistics and Progress**:


**Use Case**: <<UC1>> , <<UC4>>, <<UC5>> 

**Primary Actor**: Runner

**Precondition**: User has completed multiple running sessions.

**Trigger**: User wants to review detailed statistics and progress.

**Main Success Scenario**:

. User navigates to the app's statistics section.
. App displays comprehensive statistics, including total distance run, average pace, and heart rate trends.
. User can view progress charts over time, showing improvements or areas for focus.
. The app provides insights and suggestions for optimizing future runs based on the user's performance data.

**Success Postcondition**:
. The user gains valuable insights into their running progress, enabling them to make informed decisions for future training sessions. The app's analysis contributes to a personalized and effective training plan.

**Secondary Scenarios**:

. Technical issues prevent the app from displaying accurate statistics, causing frustration for the user.
. The user misinterprets the displayed statistics, leading to potential adjustments in their training plan.

**Importance**:
This scenario provides valuable insight to the user regarding their runs. It enriches user experience by sharing relevant statistics that allow the user to identify areas of improvement.
