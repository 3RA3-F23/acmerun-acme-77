=== (S.4) Detailed usage scenarios

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Examples of interaction between the environment (or human users) and the system, expressed as user stories. Such scenarios are not by themselves a substitute for precise descriptions of functionality (<<s3>>), but provide an important complement by specifying cases that these behavior descriptions must support; they also serve as a basis for developing test cases. The scenarios most relevant for stakeholders are given in chapter <<g5>> in the Goals book, at a general level, as use cases; in contrast, <<s4>> can refer to system components and functionality (from other chapters of the System book) as well as special and erroneous cases, and introduce more specific scenarios._  <<BM22>>
