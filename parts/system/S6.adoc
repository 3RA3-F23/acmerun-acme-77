=== (S.6) Verification and acceptance criteria

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Specification of the conditions under which an implementation will be deemed satisfactory. Here, "verification" as shorthand for what is more explicitly called "Verification & Validation" (V&V), covering several levels of testing — module testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing — as well as other techniques such as static analysis and, when applicable, program proving._  <<BM22>>

===== Functional Requirements

. **Validation Approach**: The validation of functional requirements will be administered throughout development using acceptance testing. It will be utilized to express and automate feature testing using a predefined testing framework, to showcase that the functional requirements are satisfied. Prototypes will be delivered to relevant direct stakeholders throughout the early stages of the development process. Furthermore, user acceptance testing will be conducted as a key component of the release, involving the key personas to the project. (F211)

===== Non-Functional Requirements

. **Accessibility**: The User Profile manager shall undergo user testing with participants from diverse linguistic backgorunds to ensure the the language selection is effective and responsive. The system's language switching feature must be audited internally, to assess its effectiveness at providing users with a seamless experience to choose different languages. (NF211)

. ** Personal Data Privacy**: Privacy measures will be meticulously audited during the development process. This will involve a detailed examination of the codebase to ensure encryption methods are effectively implemented, and access controls are in place. Internal audit procedures will validate that user data remains exclusively accessible to the administrative management team, reinforcing the commitment to user privacy. (NF212)

. **Compliance and Regulations**: The Geo-Fence & Trail Manager and Game Engine will be subjected to compliance checks to confirm adherence to relevant legal and regulatory requirements. This includes verification of partnerships with local authorities for selecting geographical zones and trails, as well as confirming the use of legally licensed game engines. For NF231 (Performance & responsiveness), the Game Engine's codebase will undergo testing to guarantee smooth and responsive gameplay, with performance metrics meeting or exceeding established standards. (NF221, NF231, NF232)

. **User Engagement**: The Badge & Challenge Manager will be evaluated based on its ability to enhance user engagement and make the app more attractive to users. This involves ensuring that push notifications (NF241) are implemented to provide timely and relevant updates on challenges and badges, aligning with the user's security settings. Additionally, the inclusion of visually appealing badge sprites (NF242) will be assessed through user feedback and internal assessments, aiming to motivate users by making the badge viewing experience visually engaging.
