Some invariants of this system can be defined as follows:
 
 * ACME Run will operate only within the predefined geological zones and trails and partnering shops or areas.
 
 * The application must offer players the options of sheltering, escaping, or fighting back when attacked by virtual enemies which will be based on the playerâ€™s profile and previous run statistics.
 
 * If the user's HRM is connected, the calculation of a user's maximum heart rate is based on the age of the user and the previously saved/adapted data of their heart rate.
